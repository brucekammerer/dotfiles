# Hello, friend...

# Set the prefix from C-b to C-a
set-option -g prefix C-a
# -g means global. This allows you to set an option for all tmux sessions that
# you'll create.
# `set-option` command can be abbreviated to `set`

# Free the original Ctrl-b prefix keybinding
unbind-key C-b
# `unbind-key` command can be abbreviated to `unbind`

# Set the delay between prefix and command
set-option -s escape-time 1
# -s means server. This allows you to set an option on the server. This option
# will be applied to all sessions that you'll create. The differnce between -s
# and -g is that you won't be able to redefine a server option from the current
# session.

# Set the base index for windows to 1 instead of 0
set-option -g base-index 1

# Set the base index for panes to 1 insted of 0
set-option -w -g pane-base-index 1
# -w means a window option. `pane-base-index` is a window option.

# Reload configuration
bind-key r \
    source-file ~/.config/tmux/tmux.conf \; \
    display-message "Configuration reloaded!"

# Another possible binding for reloading
# bind-key -n C-r source-file ~/.config/tmux/tmux.conf
# -n means that this command don't require pressing the prefix beforehand.
# This can be useful, but it'll block C-r shortcut for all the cli programms
# as tmux will catch it. So you should use it with caution.

# Ensure that we can send Ctrl-A to other programs.
bind-key C-a send-prefix
# You need to press C-a twice to send it to a CLI program.

# Bind more comfortable keys to the pane splitting functions.
bind-key | split-window -h
unbind-key %
bind-key - split-window -v
unbind-key \"
# -h flag means that we want to have a new pane next to the existing one.
# -v flag means that we want to have a new pane below the exising one.

# Move between panes with Prefix h, j, k, l.
bind-key h select-pane -L
bind-key l select-pane -R
bind-key k select-pane -U
bind-key j select-pane -D

# Bindings to cycle through windows in both directions.
bind-key -r C-h select-window -t :-
bind-key -r C-l select-window -t :+

bind-key -r H resize-pane -L 5
bind-key -r L resize-pane -R 5
bind-key -r J resize-pane -D 5

# -r allows you to mek the key repeatable. It means that there is a window
# of time in which you can repeat the command without pressing the prefix key.
# The default repeat limit is 500 milliseconds and you can configure it by
# setting the `repeat-time` option.
